  <h1>SnapBack Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: April 11, 2025</strong></p>
  
  <p>SnapBack is a Chrome extension that generates AI-powered email replies in Gmail. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use SnapBack, we may access the following data from your Gmail tab to generate replies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Subject</strong>: The subject line of the email thread.</li>
    <li><strong>Sender Name</strong>: The name of the email sender.</li>
    <li><strong>Email Body</strong>: Up to 1,000 characters of the latest email or reply box content, with signatures removed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We also store locally on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Credits</strong>: The number of remaining free replies (default: 3).</li>
    <li><strong>Lifetime Status</strong>: Whether you’ve purchased lifetime access.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the collected email data solely to generate replies via Google’s Gemini API (https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com). The data is sent to the API, processed, and not stored by SnapBack or the API after generating the reply. Local storage (credits, lifetime status) is used to manage your access to the extension’s features.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not store, sell, or share your email data with third parties, except for processing by the Gemini API as described above. The API’s use is governed by Google’s privacy policies.</p>
  
  <h2>4. Payment Data</h2>
  <p>If you purchase lifetime access via PayPal, we collect a Transaction ID to verify your payment. This ID is not stored or shared beyond verification.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can stop using SnapBack at any time by uninstalling the extension, which removes all locally stored data (credits, lifetime status). Since we don’t store your email data, no further action is needed.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
