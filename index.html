    <h1>SnapBack Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 24, 2025</p>
    <p>I, Sanjhai Prakash B, am committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the SnapBack Chrome extension ("the Extension"). By using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
    <p>The Extension collects the following information to provide AI-powered email reply generation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email Content</strong>: When you use the Extension to generate a reply, it accesses the subject, sender, and body of the email thread or reply box in Gmail. This data is used solely to generate a relevant reply.</li>
      <li><strong>No Personal Identifiers</strong>: I do not collect personal identifiers such as your name, email address, or Gmail account details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How I Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>I use the collected email content for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Generate Replies</strong>: The email content is sent to Google's Gemini API to generate a concise, professional reply based on the email's context.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve Functionality</strong>: I may analyze aggregated, anonymized data to improve the Extension's performance and user experience. No individual email content is stored or used for this purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>I share your email content only with the following third-party service providers to operate the Extension:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Gemini API</strong>: Email content is sent to Google's Gemini API to generate replies. Google's use of this data is governed by their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Vercel</strong>: My server-side API, hosted on Vercel, processes requests to the Gemini API. Vercel's data handling is governed by their <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/security-and-privacy/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do not store your email content on my servers or share it with any other third parties, except as required by law or to protect my rights.</p>

    <h2>4. Payments</h2>
    <p>The Extension offers five free replies. After that, you can unlock unlimited replies with a one-time purchase for lifetime access, processed through Google Play Billing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Payment Data</strong>: All payment information is securely handled by Google Play Billing. I do not collect, store, or process any payment data.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase Tracking</strong>: The Extension stores a flag in your browser’s local storage to track whether you have purchased lifetime access. This data is not linked to personal identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on how Google handles payment data, see their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p><strong>No Storage</strong>: The Extension does not store your email content. Data is processed in real-time and discarded after the reply is generated.</p>
    <p><strong>Local Storage</strong>: The Extension uses your browser’s local storage to track the number of free replies used and whether lifetime access has been purchased. This data is stored locally on your device and not transmitted to my servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Security Measures</strong>: I use industry-standard security practices, including secure API key management and HTTPS encryption, to protect data in transit. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can control how your data is used by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not Using the Extension</strong>: You may choose not to use the Extension if you do not want your email content processed.</li>
      <li><strong>Uninstalling</strong>: You can uninstall the Extension at any time via your browser's extension settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Clearing Local Storage</strong>: You can reset the free reply count or lifetime access status by clearing your browser’s local storage for the Extension, though this may require reinstalling the Extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Extension is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If I become aware of such data, I will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted within the Extension and, where required, on my website. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will reflect the effective date of changes.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Me</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at:</p>
